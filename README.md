# SalesDataPipeline
A very simple data pipeline from a MYSQL database and excel sheet to BigQuery, along with some simple analysis. 

Project Summary:

1. Demonstrate how to load BuckedUp sales data from a remote MYSQL database into GCP's BigQuery for analysis and storage. Essentially, a simplified data pipeline.
2. Visualize results (mostly revenue across time).
3. Import, clean, and combine sales data from an excel file based on Australian sales into the US sales data, and visualize results.
4. Transfer this combined table to GCP's BigQuery for further analysis and storage.
